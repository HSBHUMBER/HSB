The initial findings of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), constituted immediately after the bridge collapse in Gujarat’s Morbi town on October 30 last year, has reiterated what the police investigation and forensic report revealed. The findings suggest that 22 of the 49 cables of the Jhulta Pul, which were corroded, may have already broken before the accident. When the balance 27 cables snapped due to overcrowding, the bridge collapsed, killing 135 people.

The SIT report yet again underlines that Ajanta clock manufacturing company (Oreva Group) did not repair these cables as it was expected to under the contract, but merely gave it a fresh coat of paint and opened the swinging footbridge to visitor

What is striking about the SIT report is that it also holds the Morbi Municipality responsible for the tragedy. The report highlights administrative and technical lapses responsible for the incident. While the report primarily holds municipality chief administrator Sandeepsinh Zala responsible for signing a contract when a general resolution had not been passed by the municipality general board, it also notes that a ‘rojkam’ (work commissioning letter) was signed by municipality vice-president Jayrajsinh Jadeja, municipality president Kusum Parmar and executive committee chairman Suresh Desai. The SIT’s preliminary report has been submitted to the Gujarat High Court that is hearing the case suo motu to monitor investigations and fix compensation for the victims.

It is worrisome for the BJP that the high court has sought dissolution of the Morbi Municipality Board—the BJP-controlled elected wing—to shoulder the responsibility for the tragedy along with the company. The government has issued a showcause notice to the general board, but an appropriate response is yet to come. The SIT report bolsters the high court’s contention that the general board must also take responsibility and fresh elections should be held. Despite the saffron wave in December 2022 assembly election, reliable sources in the BJP confide that the party does not want to go to the electorate seeking votes in Morbi town in this atmosphere. The board is fighting tooth and nail against the dissolution, maintaining that the contract was negotiated and signed by Zala, who was suspended immediately after the incident, and that the board was kept in the dark about the contract

Zala is also being blamed for signing the contract with higher ticket rates, even though the municipality general board had not approved the upward revision of ticket rates. Immediately after the incident, Zala had issued a statement saying Oreva had thrown the bridge open to people without their permission and safety inspection.

Despite the tragedy, the BJP won all three seats in Morbi district (Morbi, Tankara and Wankaner) in the assembly polls. These seats were won by the Congress in 2017. The BJP’s sweep had started in 2021 itself when it won all 52 seats of the Morbi municipality. The Congress’s Brijesh Merja, who won the Morbi seat in 2017, crossed over to the BJP in 2020 and was awarded with a ministry in the first Bhupendra Patel government. But in 2022, Merja was not renominated. The BJP fell back on its winning candidate Kantilal Amrutiya, who had jumped into the Machhu river for the rescue operations after the bridge collapse, making a hero out of him.

Ten people have been arrested in the case so far. The most high profile accused, Jaysukh Patel, MD of Ajanta Manufacturing Company’s Oreva Group, surrendered on January 31, just a day before his anticipatory bail hearing, after he was named as an accused in the police chargesheet. The other nine accused include two managers of the Oreva Group, three security guards, two ticket clerks and two contractors.

1.1 Bridge Description
This report outlines an investigation of the collapse of Bridge No. SN 019-5010 in
DeKalb County, Illinois on August 19, 2008. Bridge No. SN 019-5010 crossed the South
Branch of the Kishwaukee River on Keslinger Road between First Street and Anderland
Road (Figure 1). The bridge consisted of three 42-foot spans skewed 45º left forward
approximately 14 feet above the riverbed (Figure 2). The bridge was constructed in 1976 to
service local agricultural traffic based on AASHTO HS-20 load criteria (AASHTO, 1973). The
bridge deck had 1.5 inch bituminous pavement over 17 inch deep precast, pretensioned
concrete beams simply supported by concrete pile caps. The foundation was comprised of
10 inch diameter (nominal) round oak wood piles (Figure 3). The two abutment pile caps
were supported by six piles and the two pier pile caps were supported by eight piles. The
piles were approximately 28 foot long with 17 feet extending below the riverbed. The original
bridge plans specified an allowable pile capacity of 24 tons.

1.2 Pile Treatment
 The piles were originally treated with #1 Creosote Oil by Western Tar Product
Corporation per Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) Specifications prior to
installation. Osmose treated the exposed length of the pile with TimberFume in 2000 and
2004. The TimberFume treatment can be identified by red-tipped plugs embedded in the
pile. TimberFume is a gaseous preservative designed to prevent further decay. Osmose
estimated the pile decay as 14.3% and 19% in 2000 and 2004, respectively.
1.3 Pile Repair
The bridge was inspected in 2000 by Osmose. The top six feet of piles 1 and 7
(numbered from north to south) of bent 3 were removed and replaced by new round timber
(termed “posting”). In 2004, Osmose posted pile 1 of bent 2 due to slight brooming. These
replacement posts were connected to the existing pile by four embedded steel dowels
(Figure 4). These connections were capable of transmitting axial compression through
bearing, but provide insignificant transfer of moment. The “post” connection was wrapped
with plastic sheeting and steel bands to protect the connection from corrosion and decay.
Diagonal cross bracing was added to the piles of bents 2 and 3 (the year of this
addition is not known). Two sets of four piles were braced together on each bent (Figure 3).
The bracing was added due to concerns of debris and ice buildup blocking the river flow,
thus increasing the lateral load on the piles.
1.4 Bridge Collapse
The bridge collapsed on the afternoon of August 19, 2008 (Figure 5). Bent 3 failed,
collapsing the east and middle spans. The pile cap of bent 3 rested in the riverbed,
obscuring the pile foundation. The bent 4 abutment pile cap rotated with the collapsed deck.
The west span between bents 1 and 2 remained standing. The pile to pile cap connection of
bent 3 remained intact after the collapse, maintaining its connection capable of transferring
axial force and moment (Figure 6). Since the deck was not continuous at the pile cap there
was a large rotation between the two deck segments, cracking the asphalt surface (Figure
5). The deck-to-pile cap connection consisted of steel dowels that were ductile enough to
remain connected and likely retained some of their shear strength despite the excessive
relative rotation of the deck to the pile cap.
